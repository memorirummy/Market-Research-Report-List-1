<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated External Defibrillators (AED) market is primarily divided into two types: semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated AEDs prompt the user to deliver a shock after assessing the patient's heart rhythm, allowing for some user intervention. In contrast, fully automated AEDs independently analyze the rhythm and deliver a shock without requiring user action, enhancing ease of use. Both types are critical in emergency situations, providing life-saving interventions for cardiac arrest patients.</p></p>
