<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-cleaning Surfaces Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glass market is primarily divided into two types: hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Hydrophilic surfaces attract water, allowing dirt and grime to be washed away by rain or water, enhancing cleanliness and visibility. In contrast, hydrophobic surfaces repel water, causing it to bead and roll off, taking dirt particles with it. Both types offer unique benefits for architectural applications, improving maintenance efficiency and sustaining aesthetic appeal, making them popular choices in construction and automotive industries.</p></p>
