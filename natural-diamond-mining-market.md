<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Diamond Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underground Mining</li><li>Open Pit Mining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural diamond mining involves extracting diamonds from the earth through two primary methods: underground mining and open-pit mining. Underground mining is used when diamond deposits are deep beneath the surface, requiring tunnels and advanced technology to access the ore. Open-pit mining, on the other hand, is employed for shallow deposits, where large pits are excavated to extract diamonds. Both methods cater to the global diamond market, with underground mining being costlier and more complex, while open-pit mining is more economical and scalable.</p></p>
