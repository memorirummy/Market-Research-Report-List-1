<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Immersed Liquid-Cooled Server Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Single-Phase Liquid-Cooled Server"</li><li>"Dual-Phase Liquid-Cooled Server"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fully immersed liquid-cooled server market features two main types: single-phase and dual-phase liquid-cooled servers. Single-phase liquid-cooled servers utilize a coolant that remains in a single state throughout the cooling process, typically circulating through the system to dissipate heat. In contrast, dual-phase liquid-cooled servers operate with a coolant that transitions between liquid and vapor phases, enhancing heat absorption and efficiency. Both types improve thermal management in data centers, offering energy efficiency and optimal performance for high-density computing environments.</p></p>
